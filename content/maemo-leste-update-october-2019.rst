It's been a few month since our `ninth update
<{filename}/maemo-leste-update-march-2019.rst>`_, and a lot has happened on a
technical front. That will all be covered on an early January update. This
update will mostly be about the non-technical part of Maemo Leste.

**First of all - happy new year to everyone reading this. I believe 2020 will be
a very interesting and hopefully prosperous year for the project.**


OpenFest
~~~~~~~~

In early November, we gave a talk at OpenFest 2019. Several of the core Maemo
Leste developers also met up at the event, and we also had interesting talks
with the folks from `Techno Ethical <https://tehnoetic.com/>_` - they left with
a Droid 4 to run Maemo Leste on.

The official recording of the OpenFest 2019 is not yet uploaded to youtube, but
you can find a video someone else made, here:

NLNet - funding!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You read that right, we applied for funding and we received it.
You can read the writeup here `on the website of NLNet
<https://nlnet.nl/project/MaemoLeste/>`_. We will share details in the coming
weeks.

FOSDEM 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~

Maemo Leste will be present at FOSDEM in 2020 - with a talk. This time not a
lightning talk, but a talk on Sunday, for the `Freedom track
<https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/freedom/>`_, in the Janson room,
together with someone from postmarketOS!

Once we finalise our talk abstract and description, the talk will show up on the
FOSDEM website.

updates, here's a short summary of what to expect in the technical update next
week:

* hildon-desktop rotation bug is fixed!
