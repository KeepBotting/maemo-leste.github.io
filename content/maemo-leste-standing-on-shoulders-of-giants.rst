We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Maemo `Leste`, a
GNU+Linux distribution in spirit of `Maemo Fremantle <http://maemo.org>`_,
originally developed by `Nokia` for their internet tablets and phones, like the
famous `Nokia N900`.

Maemo `Leste` aims to provide a similar experience to Maemo `Fremantle`, but
based on a modern and free software stack. The initially targetted device is the
`Nokia N900 <{filename}/pages/n900.rst>`_, but other (currently unsupported)
targets exist
(`Motorola Droid 4 <{filename}/pages/droid4.rst>`_,
`Generic AMD64 <{filename}/pages/amd64.rst>`_,
`Allwinner A20 LIME2 <{filename}/pages/allwinner_a20_lime2.rst>`_,
`Allwinner A33 Tablet <{filename}/pages/allwinner_a33_tablet.rst>`_)


History
=======

(Explain what base we are building on, N770, N800, N810, N900, N9, N950, and
make it very clear what we are -- based on latest stable DEVUAN/DEBIAN)



Interested?
