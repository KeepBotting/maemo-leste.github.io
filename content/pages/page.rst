Welcome to the Maemo Leste website; a project that aims to continue the legacy
of `Maemo <http://maemo.org/>`_. We aim to provide a Maemo experience on mobile
phones and tablets like the Nokia N900, Morotola Droid 4, Allwinner Tablets and
more.

Maemo Leste is currently based on Devuan Jessie, but we aim to update to Devuan
Ascii.

Maemo Leste is currently in development phase, so there are not yet
easy-to-install images available, nor is the project usable as a daily driver
for your device.

So far we have set up devuan/debian repositories for our packages, with builds
for armel, armhf and amd64. We have FOSS replacements for some closed maemo
packages, further building on the Maemo community efforts to replace all closed
bits by open software.

Installation guides and open tasks/issues will appear here soon. Hopefully blog
posts will also follow.
