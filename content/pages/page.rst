Welcome to the Maemo Leste website; a project that aims to continue the legacy
of `Maemo <http://maemo.org/>`_. We aim to provide a free Maemo experience on
mobile phones and tablets like the Nokia N900, Morotola Droid 4, Allwinner
Tablets and more.

Feel free to join us on irc.freenode.net #maemo-leste ; we will try to set up
(or find an appropriate) mailing list soon.

Maemo Leste is based on Devuan Ascii (Debian Stretch) and all the "supported"
devices ship with recent Linux (mainline-based) kernels.

The project is not usable as a daily driver for your device, Maemo Leste is
currently in development phase and we are actively searching for developers. For
some devices, we have development images available - such as the `N900
<{filename}/pages/n900.rst>`_.

So far we have set up devuan/debian repositories for our packages, with builds
for `armel`, `armhf` and `amd64`. We have FOSS replacements for some closed
maemo packages, further building on the Maemo community efforts to replace all
closed bits by open software.

Installation guides are provided per device. For open tasks/issues, please see
the bugtracker: https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues.

A proper overview of the current (Maemo) software state will be provided soon.
